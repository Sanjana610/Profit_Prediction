It is an ML project which is trained on some companies' past data allowing the model to predict futurte sales and make data-driven decision to improve their sales strategies.
The model uses a variety of Machine Learning algorithms including neural networks, decision trees and regression.
The methodologies used are:
i)Data Collection
ii)Data Pre-Processing
iii)Feature Engineering
iv)Model Selection
v)Model training
vi)Model Evaluation
vii)Model Optimization
viii)Forecasting
ix)Model Maintenance
ARIMAX and SARIMAX models are used.
